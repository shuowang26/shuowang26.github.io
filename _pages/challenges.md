    [[proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-23443-9)] [[website](http://cmr.miccai.cloud/organizer/)] [[dataset](http://cmr.miccai.cloud/data/)]  
    **Host**: [MICCAI STACOM 2022](https://stacom.github.io/)  
    **Abstract**: The aim of this challenge is to assess the effects of respiratory motion on CMR imaging quality and examine the robustness of segmentation models in face of respiratory motion artifacts.
