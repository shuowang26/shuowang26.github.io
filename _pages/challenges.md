In collaboration with my colleagues, we have organised the following medical image analysis challenges endorsed by MICCAI.

	    <td width="60%"><p markdown="1">**CMRxMotion: Extreme Cardiac MRI Analysis Challenge under Respiratory Motion (2022)**<br>
      [[website](http://cmr.miccai.cloud/organizer/)] [[dataset](http://cmr.miccai.cloud/data/)] [[proceedings](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-23443-9)]<br>
      **Host**: [MICCAI STACOM 2022](https://stacom.github.io/)<br>
      The aim of this challenge is to assess the effects of respiratory motion on CMR imaging quality and examine the robustness of segmentation models in face of respiratory motion artifacts.

	    <td width="60%"><p markdown="1">**CMRxRecon: Cardiac MRI Reconstruction Challenge (2023)**<br>
      This challenge aims to provide a benchmark platform for the existing cine CMR reconstruction approaches to promote advances in this area of research.

# Public datasets
In collaboration with our clinical collaborators, we have released the following public datasets.  
<table>
	<tr>
	    <td width="40%"><img  src="{{ base_path }}/images/FPPD13.png"></td>
	    <td width="60%"><p markdown="1">**False Positive Polyp Detection-13 (FPPD-13)**<br>
      [[website](https://endoboost.miccai.cloud/EndoBoost_FPPD13/)] [[dataset](https://endoboost.miccai.cloud/EndoBoost_FPPD13/)] [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12204)]<br>
      The FPPD-13 dataset provides a taxonomy and real-world cases of typical false positives during computer-aided polyp detection in colonoscopy.
